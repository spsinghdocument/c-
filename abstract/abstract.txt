If the class is created for the purpose of providing common fields and members to all subclasses then this type of class is called an abstract class.
Members of an abstract class may have any access modifier.
Abstract class methods may OR may not have an implementation.
 abstract class must be implemented by derived classes.

An abstract class cannot be instantiated.

An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.

The abstract modifier  a missing or incomplete implementation
The abstract modifier can be used with classes


using System;
class A
{
   public virtual void F() {
      Console.WriteLine("A.F");
   }
}
abstract class B: A
{
   public abstract override void F();
}
class C: B
{
   public override void F() {
      Console.WriteLine("C.F");
   }
}
